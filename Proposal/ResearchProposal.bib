	abstract = {Third-party libraries are an integral part of many software projects. It often happens that developers need to find analogical libraries that can provide comparable features to the libraries they are already familiar with for different programming languages or different mobile platforms. Existing methods to find analogical libraries are limited by the community-curated list of libraries, blogs, or Q&amp;A posts, which often contain overwhelming or out-of-date information. In this paper, we present a new approach to recommend analogical libraries based on a knowledge base of analogical libraries mined from tags of millions of Stack Overflow questions. The novelty of our approach is to solve analogical-library questions by combining state-of-the-art word embedding technique and domain-specific relational and categorical knowledge mined from Stack Overflow. Given a library and a recommended analogical library, our approach further extracts questions and answer snippets in Stack Overflow about comparison of analogical libraries, which can potentially offer useful information scents for developers to further their investigation of the recommended analogical libraries. We implement our approach in a proof-of-concept web application and more than 34.8 thousands of users visited our website from November 2015 to August 2017. Our evaluation shows that our approach can make accurate recommendation of analogical libraries. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our analogical-library recommendations by using them to answer analogical-library questions in Stack Overflow. Google Analytics of our website traffic and analysis of the visitors' interaction with website contents provide the insights into the usage patterns and the system design of our web application.},

	abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

	abstract = {The mobile app marketplace has fierce competition for mobile app developers, who need to develop and update their apps as soon as possible to gain first mover advantage. Third-party libraries (TPLs) offer developers an easier way to enhance their apps with new features. However, how to find suitable candidates among the high number and fast-changing TPLs is a challenging problem. TPL recommendation is a promising solution, but unfortunately existing approaches suffer from low accuracy in recommendation results. To tackle this challenge, we propose GRec, a graph neural network (GNN) based approach, for recommending potentially useful TPLs for app development. GRec models mobile apps, TPLs, and their interactions into an app-library graph. It then distills app-library interaction information from the app-library graph to make more accurate TPL recommendations. To evaluate GRec’s performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments based on a large-scale real-world Android app dataset containing 31,432 Android apps, 752 distinct TPLs, and 537,011 app-library usage records. Our experimental results illustrate that GRec can significantly increase the prediction accuracy and diversify the prediction results compared with state-of-the-art methods. A user study performed with app developers also confirms GRec's usefulness for real-world mobile app development.},

To get suitable libraries, developers need to search through millions of libraries by filtering, evaluating, and comparing. The vast number of libraries places a barrier for programmers to locate appropriate ones. To help developers, researchers have proposed automated approaches to recommend libraries based on library usage pattern. However, these prior studies can not sufficiently match user requirements and suffer from cold-start problem. In this work, we would like to make recommendations based on requirement descriptions to avoid these problems. To this end, we propose a novel neural approach called Req2Lib which recommends libraries given descriptions of the project requirement. We use a Sequence-to-Sequence model to learn the library linked-usage information and semantic information of requirement descriptions in natural language. Besides, we apply a domain-specific pre-trained word2vec model for word embedding, which is trained over textual corpus from Stack Overflow posts. In the experiment, we train and evaluate the model with data from 5,625 java projects. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates that Req2Lib can recommend libraries accurately.},

In recent years, it has been shown that these methods are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., subtle but non-random perturbations designed to force recommendation models to produce erroneous outputs.The goal of this survey is two-fold: (i) to present recent advances on adversarial machine learning (AML) for the security of RS (i.e., attacking and defense recommendation models) and (ii) to show another successful application of AML in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generative applications, thanks to their ability for learning (high-dimensional) data distributions. In this survey, we provide an exhaustive literature review of 76 articles published in major RS and ML journals and conferences. This review serves as a reference for the RS community working on the security of RS or on generative models using GANs to improve their quality.},

We propose attack-agnostic detection on reinforcement learning-based interactive recommendation systems. We first craft adversarial examples to show their diverse distributions and then augment recommendation systems by detecting potential attacks with a deep learning-based classifier based on the crafted data. Finally, we study the attack strength and frequency of adversarial examples and evaluate our model on standard datasets with multiple crafting methods. Our extensive experiments show that most adversarial attacks are effective, and both attack strength and attack frequency impact the attack performance. The strategically-timed attack achieves comparative attack performance with only 1/3 to 1/2 attack frequency. Besides, our black-box detector trained with one crafting method has the generalization ability over several crafting methods.},

Over the last decades, several techniques and tools have been promoted to provide developers with innovative features, aiming to bring in improvements in terms of development effort, cost savings, and productivity. In the context of the {EU} H2020 {CROSSMINER} project, a set of recommendation systems has been conceived to assist software programmers in different phases of the development process. The systems provide developers with various artifacts, such as third-party libraries, documentation about how to use the {APIs} being adopted, or relevant {API} function calls. To develop such recommendations, various technical choices have been made to overcome issues related to several aspects including the lack of baselines, limited data availability, decisions about the performance measures, and evaluation approaches. This paper is an experience report to present the knowledge pertinent to the set of recommendation systems developed through the {CROSSMINER} project. We explain in detail the challenges we had to deal with, together with the related lessons learned when developing and evaluating these systems. Our aim is to provide the research community with concrete takeaway messages that are expected to be useful for those who want to develop or customize their own recommendation systems. The reported experiences can facilitate interesting discussions and research work, which in the end contribute to the advancement of recommendation systems applied to solve different issues in Software Engineering.},

Much of this research comes from outside of the practicing data science community, leaving its members with little concrete guidance to proactively address these concerns. This article introduces issues of discrimination to the data science community on its own terms. In it, we tour the familiar data-mining process while providing a taxonomy of common practices that have the potential to produce unintended discrimination. We also survey how discrimination is commonly measured, and suggest how familiar development processes can be augmented to mitigate systems' discriminatory potential. We advocate that data scientists should be intentional about modeling and reducing discriminatory outcomes. Without doing so, their efforts will result in perpetuating any systemic discrimination that may exist, but under a misleading veil of data-driven objectivity. }

In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for Web search result diversification, which explicitly accounts for the various aspects associated to an underspecified query. In particular, we diversify a document ranking by estimating how well a given document satisfies each uncovered aspect and the extent to which different aspects are satisfied by the ranking as a whole. We thoroughly evaluate our framework in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track. Moreover, we exploit query reformulations provided by three major Web search engines (WSEs) as a means to uncover different query aspects. The results attest the effectiveness of our framework when compared to state-of-the-art diversification approaches in the literature. Additionally, by simulating an upper-bound query reformulation mechanism from official TREC data, we draw useful insights regarding the effectiveness of the query reformulations generated by the different WSEs in promoting diversity.},

When the mobile devices and cloud computing technology start to play important parts of our life, they have become more susceptible to attacks. In recent years, phishing and malicious websites have increasingly become serious problems in the field of network security. Attackers use many approaches to implant malware into target hosts in order to steal significant data and cause substantial damage. The growth of malware has been very rapid, and the purpose has changed from destruction to penetration. The signatures of malware have become more difficult to detect. In addition to static signatures, malware also tries to conceal dynamic signatures from anti-virus inspection. In this research, we use hooking techniques to trace the dynamic signatures that malware tries to hide. We then compare the behavioural differences between malware and benign programs by using data mining techniques in order to identify the malware. The experimental results show that our detection rate reaches 95% with only 80 attributes. This means that our method can achieve a high detection rate with low complexity.},

	abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the application of Machine Learning algorithms in several domains, including the development of recommender systems for software engineering (RSSE). While researchers focused on the underpinning ML techniques to improve recommendation accuracy, little attention has been paid to make such systems robust and resilient to malicious data. By manipulating the algorithms’ training set, i.e., large open-source software (OSS) repositories, it would be possible to make recommender systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper presents an initial investigation of adversarial machine learning and its possible implications on RSSE. As a proof-of-concept, we show the extent to which the presence of manipulated data can have a negative impact on the outcomes of two state-of-the-art recommender systems which suggest third-party libraries to developers. Our work aims at raising awareness of adversarial techniques and their effects on the Software Engineering community. We also propose equipping recommender systems with the capability to learn to dodge adversarial activities.},

It relates to computer vision, machine learning, and optical character recognition. This paper presents a simple model based on a deep neural network architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine learning, which can be used to detect and convert a table into a format that can be edited or searched. The motivation for this work is to develop a sound method to extract the vast data set of knowledge available in physical documents such that it can be used to develop data-driven tools that can be used to support decisions in fields such as healthcare and finance. The model uses a Yolo-based object detector trained to maximize the Intersection over Union of the detected table regions within the document image and a novel OCR-based algorithm to parse the table from each table detected in the document.Past works have all focused on documents and images containing a level and even tables. This paper aims to present our findings after the model is run on a set of skewed image datasets. Experiments on the Marmot and Publaynet datasets show that the proposed method is entirely accurate and can generalize different tables formats. At an Intersection over the Union threshold of 50%, we achieve a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 98% and an average IoU of 88.81% on the PubLayNet dataset. With the same IoU threshold, we achieve an mAP of 95.07% and an average IoU of 75.57% on the Marmot dataset.}

	abstract = {Objectives
	Data extraction from original study reports is a time-consuming, error-prone process in systematic review development. Information extraction (IE) systems have the potential to assist humans in the extraction task, however majority of IE systems were not designed to work on Portable Document Format (PDF) document, an important and common extraction source for systematic review. In a PDF document, narrative content is often mixed with publication metadata or semi-structured text, which add challenges to the underlining natural language processing algorithm. Our goal is to categorize PDF texts for strategic use by IE systems.
	Methods
	We used an open-source tool to extract raw texts from a PDF document and developed a text classification algorithm that follows a multi-pass sieve framework to automatically classify PDF text snippets (for brevity, texts) into TITLE, ABSTRACT, BODYTEXT, SEMISTRUCTURE, and METADATA categories. To validate the algorithm, we developed a gold standard of PDF reports that were included in the development of previous systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration. In a two-step procedure, we evaluated (1) classification performance, and compared it with machine learning classifier, and (2) the effects of the algorithm on an IE system that extracts clinical outcome mentions.
	Results
	The multi-pass sieve algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.6%, which was 9.7% (p<0.001) higher than the best performing machine learning classifier that used a logistic regression algorithm. F-measure improvements were observed in the classification of TITLE (+15.6%), ABSTRACT (+54.2%), BODYTEXT (+3.7%), SEMISTRUCTURE (+34%), and MEDADATA (+14.2%). In addition, use of the algorithm to filter semi-structured texts and publication metadata improved performance of the outcome extraction system (F-measure +4.1%, p=0.002). It also reduced of number of sentences to be processed by 44.9% (p<0.001), which corresponds to a processing time reduction of 50% (p=0.005).
	Conclusions
	The rule-based multi-pass sieve framework can be used effectively in categorizing texts extracted from PDF documents. Text classification is an important prerequisite step to leverage information extraction from PDF documents.}

In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) based unified framework named Table Structure Recognition Network (TSRNet) to jointly detect and recognize the structures of various tables and forms. First, a multi-task fully convolutional network (FCN) is used to segment primitive regions such as text segments and ruling lines from document images, then a GNN is used to classify and group these primitive regions into page objects such as tables and cells. At last, the relationships between neighboring page objects are analyzed using another GNN based parsing module. The parameters of all the modules in the system can be trained end-to-end to optimize the overall performance. Experiments of table detection and structure recognition for modern documents on the POD 2017, cTDaR 2019 and PubTabNet datasets and template-free form parsing for historical documents on the NAF dataset show that the proposed method can handle various table/form structures and achieve superior performance.}

	abstract = {While recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of research papers on recommender system (RS), most of the papers focus on inventing machine learning models to better fit user behavior data. However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, etc. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology “bias” is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic. The summary of debiasing methods reviewed in this survey can be found at https://github.com/jiawei-chen/RecDebiasing.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to ½ everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {Online vendors employ collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations to their customers so that they can increase their sales and profits. Although recommendation schemes are successful in e-commerce sites, they are vulnerable to shilling or profile injection attacks. On one hand, online shopping sites utilize collaborative filtering schemes to enhance their competitive edge over other companies. On the other hand, malicious users and/or competing vendors might decide to insert fake profiles into the user-item matrices in such a way so that they can affect the predicted ratings on behalf of their advantages. In the past decade, various studies have been conducted to scrutinize different shilling attacks strategies, profile injection attack types, shilling attack detection schemes, robust algorithms proposed to overcome such attacks, and evaluate them with respect to accuracy, cost/benefit, and overall performance. Due to their popularity and importance, we survey about shilling attacks in collaborative filtering algorithms. Giving an overall picture about various shilling attack types by introducing new classification attributes is imperative for further research. Explaining shilling attack detection schemes in detail and robust algorithms proposed so far might open a lead to develop new detection schemes and enhance such robust algorithms further, even propose new ones. Thus, we describe various attack types and introduce new dimensions for attack classification. Detailed description of the proposed detection and robust recommendation algorithms are given. Moreover, we briefly explain evaluation of the proposed schemes. We conclude the paper by discussing various open questions.},

However, the feedback that could be contaminated by users' misoperations or malicious operations is probably not true in real scenarios. This work aims to develop a technique based on an improved Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR), called adversarial training-based mean Bayesian personalized ranking (AT-MBPR). In this method, we divide the feedback information into three categories based on the mean Bayesian personalized ranking (MBPR), then gain the implicit feedback from the mean and non-observed items of each user, following which, adversarial perturbations are added on the embedding vectors of the users and items by playing a minimax game to reduce the noise. The experiments demonstrate in five datasets that our approach outperforms the traditional BPR methods and state-of-the-art methods used for the recommendation. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/HanXia001/Adversarial-Training-based-Mean-BPR-for-Recommender.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems (RS) are an integral part of many online services aiming to provide an enhanced user-oriented experience. Machine learning (ML) models are nowadays broadly adopted in modern state-of-the-art approaches to recommendation, which are typically trained to maximize a user-centred utility (e.g., user satisfaction) or a business-oriented one (e.g., profitability or sales increase). They work under the main assumption that users' historical feedback can serve as proper ground-truth for model training and evaluation. However, driven by the success in the ML community, recent advances show that state-of-the-art recommendation approaches such as matrix factorization (MF) models or the ones based on deep neural networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations applied on the input data. These adversarial samples can impede the ability for training high-quality MF models and can put the driven success of these approaches at high risk.As a result, there is a new paradigm of secure training for RS that takes into account the presence of adversarial samples into the recommendation process. We present adversarial machine learning in Recommender Systems (AML-RecSys), which concerns the study of effective ML techniques in RS to fight against an adversarial component. AML-RecSys has been proposed in two main fashions within the RS literature: (i) adversarial regularization, which attempts to combat against adversarial perturbation added to input data or model parameters of a RS and, (ii) generative adversarial network (GAN)-based models, which adopt a generative process to train powerful ML models. We discuss a theoretical framework to unify the two above models, which is performed via a minimax game between an adversarial component and a discriminator. Furthermore, we explore various examples illustrating the successful application of AML to solve various RS tasks. Finally, we present a global taxonomy/overview of the academic literature based on several identified dimensions, namely (i) research goals and challenges, (ii) application domains and (iii) technical overview.},

	abstract = {An Application Programming Interface (API) provides a set of functionalities to a developer with the aim of enabling reuse. APIs have been investigated from different angles such as popularity usage and evolution to get a better understanding of their various characteristics. For such studies, software repositories are mined for API usage examples. However, many of the mining algorithms used for such purposes do not take type information into account. Thus making the results unreliable. In this paper, we aim to rectify this by introducing fine-GRAPE, an approach that produces fine-grained API usage information by taking advantage of type information while mining API method invocations and annotation. By means of fine-GRAPE, we investigate API usages from Java projects hosted on GitHub. We select five of the most popular APIs across GitHub Java projects and collect historical API usage information by mining both the release history of these APIs and the code history of every project that uses them. We perform two case studies on the resulting dataset. The first measures the lag time of each client. The second investigates the percentage of used API features. In the first case we find that for APIs that release more frequently clients are far less likely to upgrade to a more recent version of the API as opposed to clients of APIs that release infrequently. The second case study shows us that for most APIs there is a small number of features that is actually used and most of these features relate to those that have been introduced early in the APIs lifecycle.},

Despite the apparent benefits of such social coding paradigm, its potential security risks have been largely overlooked (e.g., malicious codes or repositories could be easily embedded and distributed). To address this imminent issue, in this paper, we propose a novel framework (named GitCyber) to automate malicious repository detection in GitHub at the first attempt. In GitCyber, we first extract code contents from the repositories hosted in GitHub as the inputs for deep neural network (DNN), and then we incorporate cybersecurity domain knowledge modeled by heterogeneous information network (HIN) to design cyber-guided loss function in the learning objective of the DNN to assure the classification performance while preserving consistency with the observational domain knowledge. Comprehensive experiments based on the large-scale data collected from GitHub demonstrate that our proposed GitCyber outperforms the state-of-the-arts in malicious repository detection.},

	abstract = {Third-party libraries on Android have been shown to be security and privacy hazards by adding security vulnerabilities to their host apps or by misusing inherited access rights. Correctly attributing improper app behavior either to app or library developer code or isolating library code from their host apps would be highly desirable to mitigate these problems, but is impeded by the absence of a third-party library detection that is effective and reliable in spite of obfuscated code. This paper proposes a library detection technique that is resilient against common code obfuscations and that is capable of pinpointing the exact library version used in apps. Libraries are detected with profiles from a comprehensive library database that we generated from the original library SDKs. We apply our technique to the top apps on Google Play and their complete histories to conduct a longitudinal study of library usage and evolution in apps. Our results particularly show that app developers only slowly adapt new library versions, exposing their end-users to large windows of vulnerability. For instance, we discovered that two long-known security vulnerabilities in popular libs are still present in the current top apps. Moreover, we find that misuse of cryptographic APIs in advertising libs, which increases the host apps' attack surface, affects 296 top apps with a cumulative install base of 3.7bn devices according to Play. To the best of our knowledge, our work is first to quantify the security impact of third-party libs on the Android ecosystem.},

	abstract = "Modern software systems are increasingly dependent on third-party libraries. It is widely recognized that using mature and well-tested third-party libraries can improve developers’ productivity, reduce time-to-market, and produce more reliable software. Today’s open-source repositories provide a wide range of libraries that can be freely downloaded and used. However, as software libraries are documented separately but intended to be used together, developers are unlikely to fully take advantage of these reuse opportunities. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically identify third-party library usage patterns, i.e., collections of libraries that are commonly used together by developers. Our approach employs a hierarchical clustering technique to group together software libraries based on external client usage. To evaluate our approach, we mined a large set of over 6000 popular libraries from Maven Central Repository and investigated their usage by over 38,000 client systems from the Github repository. Our experiments show that our technique is able to detect the majority (77%) of highly consistent and cohesive library usage patterns across a considerable number of client systems."

abstract = "The classification of fruits offers many useful applications in daily life, such as automated harvesting or building up stocks for supermarkets. Studies have been proposed to classify fruits from input images, exploiting image processing and machine learning techniques. Though a lot of improvements have been achieved in recent years, many approaches still suffer prolonged training/testing time or a considerably high number of false positives. For several applications, it is crucial to provide users with not only precise but also real-time recommendations, which is hard to come by with state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to fruit recognition by exploiting two recently-developed classifiers that have demonstrated themselves to be both effective and efficient. We adopted EfficientNet and MixNet, two families of deep neural networks to train by means of labeled fruits and eventually to recognize unidentified fruits. The ultimate aim is to build an expert system being able to accurately and swiftly identify fruits from live images captured by a camera. Such a system can be deployed onto devices with limited computational resources such as smartphones or tablets to prompt exact and timely recommendations to users whenever they point their camera to a fruit, thereby being applicable to mainstream usage. The approach's performance has been validated on a real dataset consisting of 48,905 images for training and 16,421 images for testing. The experimental results showed that the application of EfficientNet and MixNet on the considered dataset substantially improves the overall prediction accuracy in comparison to a well-established baseline"

And although several approaches extract usage examples for libraries, they are usually tied to specific language implementations, while their produced examples are often redundant and are not presented as concise and readable snippets. In this work, we propose a novel approach that extracts API call sequences from client source code and clusters them to produce a diverse set of source code snippets that effectively covers the target API. We further construct a summarization algorithm to present concise and readable snippets to the users. Upon evaluating our system on software libraries, we indicate that it achieves high coverage in API methods, while the produced snippets are of high quality and closely match handwritten examples.",
