%\subsection{Timeline} \label{sec:ProjectPlan} % and main activities

%A tentative plan is presented as follows:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item[--] July 15th 2025: Arriving at VIASM to start the research stay.
%\item[--] From July 15th 2025 to July 31st 2025: Conducting an evaluation on different library recommender systems to investigate their ability to provide rare libraries.
%\item[--] From August 1st 2025 to August 15th 2025: Re-implementation of existing re-ranking mechanisms.
%\item[--] Organizing the first seminar for the DSLab of VIASM on the topic of: ``\emph{Popularity bias in Recommender Systems for Software Engineering.}''
%\item[--] From August 15th 2025 to August 31st 2025: Investigating reinforcement learning techniques for reducing popularity bias in the ranked list.
%\item[--] Organizing the second seminar for BK.AI on the topic of: ``\emph{Reinforcement Learning for defusing bias.}''
%\item[--] September 15th 2025: Presenting the final report on the research stay.
%\end{itemize}

% We suppose that the proposal is accepted, and the project starts at January 1st, 2024. Nevertheless, the timetable will be shifted accordingly following the actual starting date ratified by Sony.

A tentative budget plan is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Budget}. The award will be completely used for the research activities pertinent to the project. The largest part of the money will be paid two master (or PhD) students for the duration of one year. We plan to spend money for the purchase of equipment, \eg servers and laptops for running the experiments. A certain amount of the budget is reserved for registration fees and travel expense for conferences and meetings. %
