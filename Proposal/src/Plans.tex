The Gantt chart in Table~\ref{tab:GanttChart} depicts a tentative plan for the entire project. %\footnote{We anticipate that upon acceptance of the proposal, the commencement date is January 1st, 2024. However, the timetable will be adjusted accordingly to align with the officially ratified starting date by Sony.} 
Besides the activities related to the implementation and evaluation pertaining to the two defined workpackages (WP1 and WP2), % of algorithms, 
we will also devote ourselves to writing deliverables, reports, and %research 
papers. In particular, we plan to submit to Sony one deliverable every four months, and at the end of the project, %there will be 
the final report. In parallel, we will review related work, and write papers to submit to conferences and journals.

%\subsection{Budget plan} \label{sec:BudgetPlan}
%
%A tentative budget plan is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Budget}. The award will be completely used for the research activities pertinent to the project. The largest part of the money will be paid two postdoctoral researchers for the duration of one year. We also plan to spend money for the purchase of equipment, including servers and laptops for running the experiments. Moreover, a certain amount of the budget is reserved for registration fees and travel expense for conferences and meetings. %

%\subsection{Force majeure clause} \label{sec:ForceMajeureClause}
%
%We anticipate that there exist unforeseeable events that might affect the project's timeline or completion. In particular, we may %it may be the case that we 
%encounter difficulties in recruiting the %necessary 
%personnel required for the successful execution of this research project. To mitigate the risk, the Principal Investigator (PI) shall make diligent and continuous efforts to recruit the required personnel as per the project plan and budget. These efforts shall include but not be limited to advertising positions, conducting interviews, and actively seeking suitable candidates. Our priority is to look for external applicants, \ie those that come from different countries/institutions, or the neighbour Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI),\footnote{GSSI is also located in the City of L'Aquila, thus easing the recruitment \url{http://gssi.it/}} so as to avoid the so-called \emph{intellectual inbreeding}. However, in case this is not possible, %to secure the recruitment, 
%we will resort to considering our graduates, \ie those that recently got a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of L'Aquila for the open positions. %,  institution.

%If the force majeure event significantly affects the project's timeline, we will discuss with Sony %both parties agree 
%to extend project milestones and deadlines by a duration commensurate with the duration of the force majeure event. The new timeline shall be agreed upon in writing between both parties.%, \ie Sony and our group. Both parties shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the force majeure event and to resume the project activities as soon as possible. %practicable.

%In the event that the PI anticipates or encounters difficulties in recruiting the required personnel, the PI shall promptly notify the Funding Agency in writing, providing details regarding the challenges faced, potential delays, and proposed solutions. Upon notification of recruitment challenges, the PI and the Funding Agency shall engage in a collaborative discussion to explore possible modifications to the project plan, including adjustments to project scope, objectives, timelines, and budget, to mitigate the impact of the personnel shortage.
