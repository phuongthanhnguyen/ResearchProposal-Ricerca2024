%The proposed research on fairness in recommender systems for software engineering has the potential to yield several significant implications and outcomes, which can benefit both academia and industry. These implications are outlined below:

%The implications of 


%=========================

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Enhancing user trust and satisfaction.} By mitigating bias and promoting fairness in recommender systems, our approach aims to enhance user trust and satisfaction with software engineering platforms. %This will help to improve user engagement and loyalty. %Enhanced System Security: 
	%With the conceived methods to defend RSSEs against adversarial attacks, our research can enhance the security and robustness of recommender systems used in software engineering platforms. This is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring system integrity. %Preservation of User Trust: 
	As users rely on recommendations to make critical decisions in software engineering, our research helps to preserve user trust by ensuring that recommendations remain trustworthy.

	\item \textbf{Improving system performance.} Fairness-aware recommender systems are likely to generate recommendations that are not only unbiased but also more accurate and relevant to users. This improvement in recommendation quality can positively impact the overall performance of software engineering platforms. %The ability to thwart adversarial attacks can help maintain the reliability of recommender systems, ensuring that users receive dependable recommendations even in the presence of malicious actors.

%	\item \textbf{Ethical and responsible AI development.} Addressing fairness issues in recommender systems aligns with the principles of ethical and responsible AI development. Our research contributes to the responsible use of AI in software engineering by reducing potential biases and discrimination. %Protection of User Privacy: 
%	Addressing adversarial attacks can lead to improved protection of user privacy within recommender systems. This is particularly important in software engineering, where proprietary and confidential information is frequently handled.
 
%%	\item \textbf{Industry Adoption.} 
%	\item \textbf{Applicability.} 
%%	The recent years witness a proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs). 
%	The potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering has been considered to be enoumous~\cite{10109345}. %Among others, ... still containing bias. 
%	Nevertheless, such models are trained with a lot of data coming from different sources, and among other issues, bias and adversarial attacks. LLMs still rely on prompt tuning to function, \ie to be tailored for a specific purpose, they need to be fine tuned with proper data. In this respect, the techniques conceived from this research project can come in handy, defusing bias, and detecting adversarial intents in the training data. % can be used.
%	For industry, our approach and research outcomes can be adopted by software engineering companies, and integrated into their recommender systems. This will foster a culture of fairness and inclusivity in the industry, as well as the attitude towards the protection of users from adversarial threats. %Our defense mechanisms and research outcomes can be adopted by software engineering companies, enhancing the security of their recommender systems and protecting their users from adversarial threats.


	
	\item \textbf{Applicability.} The potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering has been recently acknowledged~\cite{10109345}. However, these models are trained on vast and diverse datasets, which can introduce biases. Additionally, LLMs often require prompt tuning to tailor them to specific purposes, necessitating fine-tuning with relevant data. 
	In this context, the techniques developed in this research project offer practical solutions by mitigating biases within training data for LLMs. For the software engineering industry, our approach and research outcomes hold substantial promise, \ie they can be readily adopted by software companies, seamlessly integrated into their recommender systems. This adoption promotes a culture of fairness and inclusivity within the industry. %Furthermore, it underscores a commitment to safeguarding users from potential adversarial threats. 
	%By addressing these critical issues, our research significantly enhances the applicability of Large Language Models in software engineering, making them more robust, ethical, and aligned with industry standards.
	
	\item \textbf{Educational impact.} The ethical implications of AI, including bias mitigation and adversarial counteraction, have gained significant attention in recent years. Our research offers an opportunity to educate future AI professionals about the importance of ethical considerations when developing AI-based systems.

%Recommender systems, as one of the most widespread applications of machine learning, play a significant role in aiding human decision-making processes. The quality of the recommendations they generate is closely linked to user satisfaction and the interests of the platforms. However, because recommender systems heavily rely on data and algorithms, they can be susceptible to biases that may lead to unfair outcomes, potentially eroding trust in the systems. Consequently, it is imperative to address fairness issues in recommendation scenarios. %Recent attention has been increasingly focused on considerations of fairness within recommender systems, resulting in a growing body of literature dedicated to methods aimed at promoting fairness in recommendations.



%Fairness is an ongoing topic in the domain of Recommender Systems.
%
%Our aim is to develop suitable techniques to tackle popularity bias, and adversarial threats to RSSEs. The implication is ... Systems usually provide very popular libraries to developers. 
%
%We are the first to raise the issue of popularity bias, and adversarial attacks to RSSEs. We will propose a holistic approach to make RSSEs fair and attack-proof, employing and tailoring reinforcement learning, and adversarial training for this purpose. The conceived techniques can be applied to fine tune pre-trained deep learning models in Software Engineering.%applied in real-world recomm

%Through RQ$_2$, we noticed that the characteristics of datasets are a contributing factor in the ability of \LS to mitigate popularity bias. In fact, DS$_3$ contains a considerably large number of projects (56,091), but only a small number of libraries (762). In contrast, compared to DS$_3$, DS$_2$ has a lower number of projects (5,200), but its number of libraries is substantially higher (31,817). In this respect, the distribution of the libraries across the projects in DS$_3$ is much denser than that of DS$_2$, as the former features projects from the same ecosystem (Android). It is then necessary to perform an in-depth analysis of how the characteristics of a dataset impact on the ability of TPL recommender systems to deal with popularity bias. % On the other hand, \LS attempts to mitigate bias by increasing the relevance of unpopular libraries with an adaptive weighting scheme.
